# Open-Source Web Dev Boilerplate 🌐

A minimal, flexible, and beginner-friendly full-stack web development boilerplate built with Python (backend) + HTML/CSS/JS (frontend).  
Perfect for prototyping, learning, or starting small to mid-size web projects — with zero lock-in and maximum contributor freedom.
