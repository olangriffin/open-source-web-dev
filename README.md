# Open Source Web Dev Boilerplate

A starter / learning-friendly web development boilerplate using Python (backend), HTML/CSS/JS (frontend) and standard web-dev tooling.  

> A simple template and foundation to build small-to-medium web projects — ideal for learning, prototyping, and collaborative open-source contributions.

## ✨ Why this project exists

- To provide a **ready-made skeleton** for typical web applications — so you don’t have to start from scratch every time.  
- To offer a **clean, minimal, and opinionated setup** (backend + frontend + routing + templating + static assets) — useful for students, hobbyists, small teams.  
- To act as a **learning resource** for web-dev newcomers: you can examine working structure, run it locally, modify and extend it.  
- To support **collaborative development** — open for contributions, enhancements, example apps, bug fixes, extra features, etc.
