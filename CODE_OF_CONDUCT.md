# Code of Conduct

This project is a learning-focused, community-driven space for building and sharing web application templates.  
Everyone participating in this repository is expected to help make it a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment.

---

## 1. Our Commitment

As maintainers and contributors we commit to:

- Creating a friendly and collaborative place for people to learn and practice web development.
- Treating everyone with respect, regardless of experience level, background, identity, or location.
- Giving constructive, considerate feedback.
- Acting quickly when behaviour harms or risks harming the community.

---

## 2. Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and inclusive in language and tone.
- Being patient with beginners and questions.
- Offering helpful, actionable feedback instead of blunt criticism.
- Acknowledging and correcting mistakes without blaming others.
- Focusing on what’s best for the project and the community.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or abusive language.
- Personal attacks, trolling, or insults.
- Unwanted sexual or violent language or imagery.
- Publishing others’ private information (doxxing) without explicit permission.
- Deliberately derailing discussions or spamming issues/PRs.
- Aggressive demands for support or entitlement toward maintainers.

---

## 3. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- All activity in this repository and related spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, code review, docs, etc.).
- Any other project-related channels where contributors interact (for example, links or discussions referenced from this repo).

---

## 4. Maintainer Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for:

- Clarifying standards of acceptable behaviour.
- Monitoring interactions and taking action where needed.
- Editing, removing, or rejecting comments, commits, code, issues, or other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.
- Temporarily or permanently banning any contributor for behaviour they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

Maintainers will always try to act fairly and consistently, but the health of the community comes first.

---

## 5. Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct:

- You can open an issue with the label `code-of-conduct` **if you are comfortable doing so**, or  
- You can contact the repository owner directly via their GitHub profile.

When reporting, please include:

- What happened (with links/screenshots if possible).
- Where it happened (issue, PR, discussion, etc.).
- Approximate date/time.
- Whether the behaviour is ongoing.

All reports will be reviewed as promptly as possible. Details will be kept as confidential as reasonably possible.

---

## 6. Enforcement Guidelines

When a Code of Conduct violation is confirmed, maintainers may use one or more of the following actions:

1. **Informal reminder**  
   - A private or public reminder of the Code of Conduct and why the behaviour is not acceptable.

2. **Official warning**  
   - A clear warning that further violations may result in restrictions or a ban.

3. **Temporary restrictions**  
   - Temporarily limiting a contributor’s ability to comment, open issues, or submit pull requests.

4. **Permanent ban**  
   - Removing a contributor from the project and blocking them from future participation.

The specific response will depend on the severity and frequency of the behaviour.

---

## 7. Guidance for Technical Feedback

Because this is a learning-focused project:

- It is expected that code will be imperfect and that people will ask basic questions.
- Feedback should be focused on the code or content, not the person.
- When pointing out problems, try to offer suggestions or links to resources where possible.

Example of helpful feedback:

> “This route works, but returns a 200 even when there’s an error. Consider using `HTTPException` to send a 400/500 instead. Here’s a link to the docs…”

## 8. Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by and adapted from common open-source codes of conduct, including the Contributor Covenant and other community guidelines, with modifications to suit the goals of the **open-source-web-dev** project.
